### Work in progress!

# vue-scheduler


> I didn't find anything simpler like this in another project so I made this for a work related project and I saw the opportunity to make it a package so I could share it.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
